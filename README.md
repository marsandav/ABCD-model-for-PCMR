ABCD transfer matrix model of Gaussian beam propagation in plano-concave microresonator (PCMR) interferometers

This script has been used to compute the results from the paper: David Martin-Sanchez, Edward Z. Zhang, Paul C. Beard, and James A. Guggenheim, "An ABCD transfer matrix model of light propagation in plano-concave microresonators".

If you publish scientific results based on this script, please consider citing the paper.

This script has been implemented in Matlab.
